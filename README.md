# To-Do _Countdown_

This is a Bloc.io project that I revamped to fit my personal idea for where this
app should go.

This task list app will track your task's deadline's, removing them from the list
as once they expire. This way your task list doesn't get cluttered with things 
you keep meaning to do!

With this app, you can create a task list that doesn't get cluttered.
This is achieved by setting a deadline for every task. Once that deadline
is reached, the app automatically removes the task from the list.

##### The main features added are:

- Expired Tasks do not get deleted, only removed from the main view.
- Users can set the deadline from 1-7 days. (default is 7)
- Find and friend other users
- Most of the app runs with AJAX.
